## Design

### Colour scheme

![Colour scheme](assets/images/readme/colour-scheme.png) 

The website uses a palette of pastel colours that are often used in the swhomes images. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the Roboto Mono, it is used for the entire site. It is a sans-serif font. It was chosen as it looked clean and modern.

![Font](assets/images/readme/font.png)

### Imagery

The home and contact images were taken from Pexels.com. All gallery images were taken from archdaily.com. I have credited these in the [Credits](#Credits) section.
All images were compressed through imagify.io and some formats were changed using cloudconvert.com. Chosen images are by random artists and were picked solely based on the style of the business product.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop. The wireframes were generates using balsamic, and the images were modified with canvas.

### Features

#### Navigation bar in header

This website is comprised of four pages, all of them are accessible from the navigation menu. The full responsive navigation bar includes links from the name of the web (SWHome) to the Home page, and links to each of the four pages, Home, About, Gallery and Contact, and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

The navigation bar is located in the upper right corner and for smaller screens it is responsive becoming a hamburger menu. 

This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

The active page is underlined to allow easy understanding of where the user is within the website.

#### Contact page

#### Future implementations

Overall performance of the website can be improved as some parts of the site are slowing it down. Links to the full projects can be added to the gallery section to provide a more complete experience. Newest Architecture technologies could also be included as well as information on materials and interior design. Unfortunately, this type of addition required more technical knowledge.

#### Accessibility

Alt-labels are used for images. Aria-labels for screen readers are implemented at certain places, also semantic elements are used so the page is easy to navigate.
