# Design

## Colour Scheme

![Colour scheme](assets/images/readme/colour-scheme.png) 

The website uses a palette of pastel colours that are often used in the swhomes images. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

## Typography

Google Fonts was used for the Roboto Mono, it is used for the entire site. It is a sans-serif font. It was chosen as it looked clean and modern.

![Font](assets/images/readme/font.png)

## Imagery

The home and contact images where taken from Pexels.com. All gallery images were taken from archDaily.com. I have credited these in the [Credits](#Credits) section.
All images were compressed through imagify.io and some formats were changed using cloudconvert.com. Chosen images are by random artists and were picked solely based on the style of the business product.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop. The wireframes were generates using balsamic, and the images were modified with canvas.

### Future Implementations

Overall performance of the website can be improved as some parts of the site are slowing it down. Links to the full projects can be addes to the gallery section to provide a more complete experince. Newest Architecture tecnologies could also be included as well as information on materials and interior designe. Unfortunately this type of addition required more technical knowledge.
