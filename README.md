## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Colour scheme](assets/images/readme/colour-scheme.png)<br>

The website uses a palette of pastel colours that are often used in the swhomes images. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the Roboto Mono, it is used for the entire site. It is a sans-serif font. It was chosen as it looked clean and modern.

The home and contact images where taken from Pexels.com. All gallery images were taken from archDaily.com. I have credited these in the [Credits](#Credits) section.
All images were compressed through imagify.io. Chosen images are by random artists and were picked solely based on the style of the business product.
